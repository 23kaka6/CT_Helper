# CT_Helper

'''Carbon trading data does not exhibit either stationary or highly volatile
time series behavior, making it challenging to analyze and model on carbon
trading data. To address this issue, we first train an optimal trading strategy
model using reinforcement learning. Then, the trained model is evaluated
using data from 8 authentic carbon trading institutions. Next, we introduce
the classic time series trading models as the baseline for comparison. In the
experimental evaluation, the model we proposed achieves profitability in the
majority of the trading scenarios. Compared to the Buy-and-Hold strategy,
CT Helper yields superior results. The experimental results demonstrate
that our proposed AI-assisted carbon trading models achieve good performance, highlighting the practical significance of real-world applications for
carbon trading assistance.'''
